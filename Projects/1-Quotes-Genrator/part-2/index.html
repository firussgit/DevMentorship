    <h1>Project 1 - Random Quotes Generator</h1>
    <p>Now, we'll try to output some text from a list to that paragraph</p>

    <p id="target">Click the button to generate a quote</p>
    <button>Generate</button>

    <script>
        // A list of quotes to generate one from it on the paragraph and show it to the user
        const quotes = ["Quote One", "Quote Two", "Quote Three"] // These are not quotes, I know. These are just some simple placeholders

        // Targeting elements
        const target = document.querySelector("#target")
        const button = document.querySelector("button")

        // Attaching EventListener
        button.addEventListener("click", () => {
            target.textContent = quotes[0] // Here, we are saying pick the first element from the list then put it in the paragraph, you can change the number between [] to show another element from the list
        })

        // We see that we can only show one element of choice only from the code, by changing the index number between those []
        // What we want is showing a random element from the list each time we click the button, we'll see that in the next parts!
