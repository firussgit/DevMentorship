    <h1>Project 1 - Random Quotes Generator</h1>
    <p>Now, we'll see how to generate a random number, then use that to our advantage.</p>

    <p id="target">Click the button to generate a random number</p>
    <button>Generate a random number</button>

    <script>
        // Targeting elements
        const target = document.querySelector("#target")
        const button = document.querySelector("button")

        // Attaching EventListener
        button.addEventListener("click", () => {
            target.textContent = Math.floor(Math.random() * (5 - 0) + 0)
            // Here, we used "Math.random()" to generate a random float between 0 and 1
            // Then we multiplied it by (max - min) + min where max is the maximum number in the range and the min is the minimum
            // (Keep in mind that the max number is not included, for example if you want a number between 0 and 10 you must do 0 and 11)
            // Then we used "Math.floor" on it to floor it to the lowest value, like 1.5 becomes 1 and 9.8 becomes 9
            // So here, we are generating a random number between 0 and 5, excluding the 5 so it gives us a number between 0 and 4
            // Keep clicking the button and you'll see that it keeps generating a number each time you click!
            // Next, we'll use the generated number to show a random quote each time we click
        })
    </script>
