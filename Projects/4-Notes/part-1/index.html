    <h1>Notes - Part 1</h1>
    <p>In this project we'll learn about creating dynamically HTML elements using JavaScript by creating a simple Notes
        App</p>
    <p>We'll start by generating a paragraph as an example</p>

    <br>

    <!-- This is a div that would serve as a container for the elements we gonna generate -->
    <!-- In this case, it'll contain the paragraph -->
    <div id="content"></div>

    <script src="scripts.js"></script>
