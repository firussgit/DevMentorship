    <h1>Rolling Dice - Part 1</h1>
    <p>At the end of this project we'll have a Rolling Dice Simulator</p>
    <p>We'll have button to roll the dice and a field where we check how much we rolled.</p>
    <p>We'll simply use the random number generation as we learned before, but I'll introduce to how to simulate the
        behavior of: <b>Waiting.. Or Please wait..</b></p>

    <br>

    <p>We start by making the interface.</p>

    <br>

    <!-- We give them some id's to select them later in the JavaScript -->
    <p id="numRolled">Click to roll the dice!</p>
    <button id="rollBtn">Roll the Dice!</button>
</body>
