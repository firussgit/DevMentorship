    <h1>Project 2 - Counter</h1>
    <p>At the end of this project we'll have 2 buttons and a number</p>
    <p>One of the two buttons increments the number with 1 and the other one decrements it by 1 as well</p>

    <br>

    <p>First, we'll start by making the paragraph where the number will be shown to the user and the two buttons</p>

    <br>

    <p id="number">0</p> <!-- This is where our number will be shown -->
    <button id="increment">Increment (+1)</button>
    <button id="decrement">Decrement (-1)</button>
