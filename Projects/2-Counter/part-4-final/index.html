    <h1>Project 4 Final - Counter</h1>
    <p>The project is complete and works as expected, but I want to add something cool</p>

    <br>

    <p>We want when the number is 0 the color of the number is black</p>
    <p>When it is a positive number, it becomes blue</p>
    <p>When it is a negative number, it becomes red</p>
    <p>Cool, right?</p>

    <br>

    <p>We can add a Reset button as well that sets the count to 0</p>

    <br>

    <p><b id="number"></b></p> <!-- We added "b" tag to make the number bold so we can see colors easily -->
    <button id="increment">Increment (+1)</button>
    <button id="decrement">Decrement (-1)</button>
    <button id="reset">Reset</button>
